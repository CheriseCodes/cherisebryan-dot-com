### Bio

I am a cloud professional and skilled computer programmer who is passionate about building secure, reliable, and scalable platforms. On this blog, I write about the techniques I've used to accomplish these goals.

In addition to an early interest in video games and sci-fi, my fascination with building computer programs started when I witnessed my older brother *"magically"* change the appearance of a website using CSS.

Since then, I've completed a degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto (HBSc), acquired a variety of AWS and Kubernetes certifications, and pursued a career as a Cloud Engineer at the Bank of Montr√©al (BMO).

#### Fun Facts

- I was born in Jamaica and immigrated to Canada as a kid
- I grew up in Pickering, Ontario (quiet and filled with nature)
- I've travelled to 8 countries (3 were solo trips)
- I like to run, cycle, and swim
- I've explored a bit of these languages: French, Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese
