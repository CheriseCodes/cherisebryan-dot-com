In addition to an early interest in video games and sci-fi, my fascination with building computer programs started when I witnessed my older brother *"magically"* change the appearance of a website using CSS.

Since then, I've completed a degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto (HBSc), acquired a variety of AWS and Kubernetes certifications, and pursued a career as a Cloud Engineer at the Bank of Montr√©al (BMO).

#### Fun Facts

- I've travelled to 9 countries (3 were solo trips)
- I like to run, cycle, and swim
